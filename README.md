<code>git push heroku master</code>

### Edits

A few different approaches have been tried with the deployment
of this app. I have settled on heroku as this app is a short term 
measure.

All the gulp generated files are .gitignore 'd and instead
gulp is added as a project dependency (not devDependency) and a
post install npm task is run.

So far so good.
